// Strip Debug Symbols During Copy
// 
// Specifies whether binary files that are copied during the build, such as in a Copy
// Bundle Resources or Copy Files build phase, should be stripped of debugging symbols.
// It does not cause the linked product of a target to be strippedâ€”use
// `STRIP_INSTALLED_PRODUCT` for that.

// Enable Foundation Assertions
// 
// Controls whether assertion logic provided by `NSAssert` is included in the
// preprocessed source code or is elided during preprocessing. Disabling assertions can
// improve code performance.

// Produce Debugging Information
// 
// Debugging information is required for shader debugging and profiling.

// Validate Built Product
// 
// If enabled, perform validation checks on the product as part of the build process.
