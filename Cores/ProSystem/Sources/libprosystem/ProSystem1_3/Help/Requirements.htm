Below is a list of the minimum and recommended requirements needed to run the ProSystem emulator. Meeting the minimum requirements means that you can run the emulator but you may have to change some of the settings (turn off the sound, run in fullscreen mode, use frame skipping). Meeting the recommended requirements means that you may be able to run the emulator with all the options enabled. Neither set of requirements guarantees that the emulator will perform as advertised.<BR>
