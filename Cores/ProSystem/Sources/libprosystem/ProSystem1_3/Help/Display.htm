<DIV><BR><FONT face=arial size=4><B>Display</B></FONT><BR>The Display menu 
allows you to set the display properties of the emulator like the display mode, 
zoom and stretch, and window mode. You can also set the custom palette or 
default palette and take snapshots of the current display.<BR><BR><B>Setting 
fullscreen mode</B><BR>You can set the emulator to display graphics in 
fullscreen mode by going to the display sub-menu (in the <A 
href="Options.htm">options</A> menu) and selecting the Fullscreen menu item or 
use the shortcut <FONT color=green><B>Ctrl+F</B></FONT>. You can also choose 
which display mode is used in the fullscreen window by going to the modes 
sub-menu in the display menu and select one of the display modes (all fullscreen 
display modes use 8 bpp). The display mode will change immediately after 
selecting the menu-item if you are in the fullscreen mode, otherwise the display 
mode will be displayed when you change to the fullscreen mode. The default 
display mode is 640x480x8. You can also choose to stretch the display so that it 
fills the entire screen by selecting the Stretched menu item from the display 
sub-menu. A check mark will be next to the display mode, stretched and 
fullscreen menu items indicating the current selection.<BR><BR><B>Setting window 
mode</B><BR>The window mode is the default mode. You can switch to window mode 
if you are in fullscreen mode by going to the display sub-menu and selecting the 
fullscreen menu item or use the shortcut <FONT color=green><B>Ctrl+F</B></FONT>. 
Display modes and the stretching option have no effect in window mode, but can 
be selected so that the changes take effect when you choose to go to fullscreen 
mode. You can also set the zoom level of the window by going to the display 
sub-menu and choosing the x1, x2, x3, or x4 menu item. This will set how much 
the window is resized in respect to the display dimensions. A check mark will be 
next to the zoom menu item indicating the zoom level chosen.<BR><BR><B>Using 
palettes</B><BR>You can choose to use a custom palette or default palette by 
going to the display sub-menu and selecting the palette menu item. The Palette 
dialog box will be displayed, which will allow you to select the target palette 
file to be loaded. If a palette file has already been loaded, it will be 
displayed in the Palette dialog box. Navigate to the palette file and select the 
Open button. If you want to use the default palette instead of a custom palette, 
you can select the default button in the dialog box.<BR><BR><IMG 
src="./images/PaletteDialog.jpg"><BR><BR>Palette files have a size of 768 bytes. 
Each collection of 3 bytes define the RGB color. The C++ code to create the 
palette would look like the following:<BR><BR><FONT face=Courier size=2>struct 
rgb {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;unsigned char r;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;unsigned char 
g;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;unsigned char b;<BR>}<BR><BR>rgb palette[255] = 
{...}<BR></FONT><BR><B>Taking screen snapshots</B><BR>You can take snapshots of 
the screen by going to the display sub-menu and selecting the snapshot menu item 
or use the shortcut <FONT color=green><B>F12</B></FONT>. The snapshots are saved 
as bitmap files. Every file is stored in .BMP format with the same name as ROM + 
unique number (as in MESS, MAME).</DIV>

<DIV>For&nbsp;better conveniences, after cartridge loading, it is possible to 
adjust a format of screenshots. <STRONG><FONT color=#008000>Remove non-web 
symbols</FONT></STRONG> - deletes from a name of a screenshot symbols which can 
cause problems at the publication of pictures on the Internet. <FONT 
color=#008000><STRONG>Replace spaces by "_"</STRONG></FONT> replaces all symbols 
of&nbsp;space (" ")&nbsp;with an underlining sign "_" (it the problem of 
compatibility with some web servers 
dares).<BR><BR></DIV></BASEFONT></BODY></HTML>
